## 🔥 Lessons Learned

Although the alert was ultimately classified as a false positive, it was a very good example of how to deal with an event that often occurs in the daily work of a SOC team. 
Incidents of this type cannot be underestimated and require thorough analysis each time, as they may contain various types of malicious artifacts.

Every alert should be verified, even if it seems insignificant at first glance. As SOC analysts, we must remain vigilant and conduct our investigations in a thorough and methodical manner.

This laboratory training gave us the following skills:
- it strengthened our skills in using online tools such as AbusedIPDB and VirusTotal.
- detecting threats
- gathering information about threats
- documenting incident response
